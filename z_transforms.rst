Introduction to Z-transforms
****************************

In this module we will introduce the idea of a z-transform.  For those of you who are familiar with Laplace transforms, the z-transform can basically be seen as the discrete time equivalent of the Laplace transform.  The z-transform will share many of the same properties as the Laplace transform.  For those of you who are not familiar with the Laplace transform then the information provided should be sufficient for your understanding.

Simple Example of a Difference Equation
=======================================
Before we explore the capabilities of a z-transform we must understand what a difference equation.
