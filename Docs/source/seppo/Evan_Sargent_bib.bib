  abstract={Many argue that the intrinsic uselessness of fiat money makes ``coordination'' an essential part of monetary theory: consumers could all equally well coordinate on believing that fiat money has no value. The coordination view suggests, however, that many transactions patterns are in fact possible as economic outcomes. Indeed, we do seem to observe different patterns of exchange at different times and in different places, and the relative importance of money is probably not a universal constant. The main goal of this paper is to develop a simple model of money's role as a medium of exchange when multiple transaction patterns are possible. The coordination view is conveniently analyzed in a dynamic version of Shubik's game-theoretic trading post economy. This economy allows a role for fiat money, and fiat money can coexist with barter in exchange. There are multiple decentralized equilibria, and one of these coincides with the equilibrium of a cash-in-advance economy: the model can be viewed as a generalization of the cash-in-advance framework. Other equilibria use both money and other, intrinsically valuable, objects as media of exchange. One implication of the coordination view is that the effects of monetary policy in general depend on the equilibrium transactions pattern. The paper illustrates this point by showing how estimates of the welfare costs of inflation may be biased depending on the econometrician's beliefs about the transactions patterns.},

%  abstract={One measure of the health of the Social Security system is the difference between the market value of the trust fund and the present value of benefits accrued to date. How should present values be computed for this calculation in light of future uncertainties? We think it is important to use market value. Since claims on accrued benefits are not currently traded in financial markets, we cannot directly observe a market value. In this paper, we use a model to estimate what the market price for these claims would be if they were traded. <br> <br>In valuing such claims, the key issue is properly adjusting for risk. The traditional actuarial approach â€“ the approach currently used by the Social Security Administration in generating its most widely cited numbers - ignores risk and instead simply discounts â€œexpectedâ€ future flows back to the present using a risk-free rate. If benefits are risky and this risk is priced by the market, then actuarial estimates will differ from market value. Effectively, market valuation uses a discount rate that incorporates a risk premium. <br> <br>Developing the proper adjustment for risk requires a careful examination of the stream of future benefits. The U.S. Social Security system is â€œwage-indexedâ€: future benefits depend directly on future realizations of the economy-wide average wage index. We assume that there is a positive long-run correlation between average labor earnings and the stock market. We then use derivative pricing methods standard in the finance literature to compute the market price of individual claims on future benefits, which depend on age and macro state variables. Finally, we aggregate the market value of benefits across all cohorts to arrive at an overall value of accrued benefits.<br> <br>We find that the difference between market valuation and â€œactuarialâ€ valuation is large, especially when valuing the benefits of younger cohorts. Overall, the market value of accrued benefits },
